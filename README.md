Project Title: Python GUI Mini-Apps Collection

Overview:
This repository includes a set of simple, beginner-friendly Python desktop applications created using the Tkinter library. The project serves as a practice ground for building interactive graphical user interfaces and understanding basic event-driven programming in Python.

Contents:

1. Scientific Calculator (calculator.py)
   A fully functional scientific calculator with a graphical interface. Users can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as well as scientific functions such as square root, power, logarithm (base 10 and natural log), trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), and factorial. The interface includes buttons for each operation and a display to show the current expression or result. Input is evaluated securely using the math library.

2. To-Do List App (todo.py)
   A basic to-do list desktop application that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can add tasks through an input box, view all tasks in a list box, and delete selected tasks. The app provides input validation to prevent empty tasks and handles selection errors gracefully. It is a great starting point for learning how to manage list-based data in a GUI environment.

3. Login Script Demo (login.py)
   A simple script for demonstrating Python list operations and slicing. It prints out various outputs using reverse slicing and indexing. This file appears to be for educational or testing purposes and does not represent a functional login system.

Usage:
Each file can be run independently. To launch any of the GUI applications, ensure you have Python installed and then run the file using the command:
python filename.py

For example:
python calculator.py

Requirements:

* Python 3.x
* Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

Goals:
This project is intended for educational purposes, especially for beginners learning Python GUI development. It demonstrates how to use widgets like buttons, entry boxes, list boxes, and message boxes, as well as how to handle user input and perform basic calculations and list management.

Contributions:
Suggestions and improvements are welcome. This project could be extended by adding new features such as saving tasks to a file, theme customization, or expanding calculator functions.
